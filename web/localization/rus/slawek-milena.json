    {"slawek-milena-p-1":"It&apos;s the second time that we&apos;ve welcome to Riga one of best pairs of dancers and instructors of Kizomba and Bachata in Poland. Due to their craft and the quality of their lessons and shows, they have been invited to give workshops and do shows at major international festivals (Warsaw Salsa Festival, Warsaw Kizomba Festival, Angolan Festival in Krakow, Wroclaw Salsa Festival, Latino Festival, Fire Festival in Minsk, On The Wave Bachata and Kizomba Festival in Riga, Toma Toma Festival in Bratislava, Bachaturo in Warsaw and many others)."},
    {"slawek-milena-p-2":"Sławek and Milena have been dancing together for over 2 years, and the rhythms of kizomba and bachata are like their heartbeats – they keep them company from the moment they wake up, through their car rides, until the time they say goodnight. As soon as their bodies hold against each other, the outside world ceases to exist and they can feel this lovely tension coming from their smooth movements. Gentle touch, being aware of the other person and this soothing closeness are the most pleasurable sensations they get from dancing and share these with their students. Their extensive experience has enabled them to develop a unique way of teaching, in which they pay attention to the basics and teach to feel free to express yourself in the dance, focusing on having fun."}
