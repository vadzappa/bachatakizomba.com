                    Originally from Senegal, DJ Babacar came to Europe as teenager and
                    developped his love for music and dancing (HipHop, Jazz, African, French
                    Caribbean and Latin). This lead him to play piano and the trompette.
                    When his work took him to Porto he found his passion for DJing, settled
                    there and took a course in Djing and Music Production. He has become

                    in Salsa, African Rythms and more urban tunes, and his love for
                    dancing (he is a great salsero and teach alongside his wife) makes him a
